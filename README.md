# Test backend
## What is this?

This is a first attempt at generating a working backend using GraphQL, through Apollo server. It utilises a simple NoSQL database using MongoDB, and stores "Songs". It contains simple Queries and Mutations.

It contains automatic deployment on GitLab to Heroku as it was created on GitLab and from there moved to GitHub for viewing purposes. 

It also supports hot reloading, on both Windows and Unix systems.
